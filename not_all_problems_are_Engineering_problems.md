# Not all problems are Engineering problems

Some time ago, I was invited to participate in a design review meeting for a system to handle receiving equipment from a supplier company. It should be a no-brainer: the supplier sends a manifest with full description of what is being delivered, so I was intrigued by the need to build such system. It happened that the supplier was sending incorrect manifests, with missing items, wrong lists and, in some cases, empty lists.

So, they started developing a complicated system involving reading the QR code from the received items, trying to relate received items (such as what items contained other items), verifying whether all items are in working conditions plus an ever growing number of complicated steps that must be performed in a very delicate sequence.

They were trying to solve this situation as an Engineering problem when it was a Procurement problem. With a correct manifest from the supplier, none of this would be necessary. The real solution should be to engage Procurement Managers to ensure the delivered equipment is exactly what is stated in the manifest and in full working conditions.

People at the design review were befuddled when I called their attention to this fact, the proverbial deer in the headlights. They continued designing and developing the system anyhow, five engineers for over six months. Later, quite predictably, the physical configuration for the delivered items had changed and they needed to start all over. Last time I saw, the project was still trudging.

I am not advocating a Six-Sigma solution for this kind of problem, just plain common-sense. One of the best engineers I have ever met said that Engineering is about cost-benefit. Solving this problem with Procurement management would take days, with high level of certainty. The Engineering solution was two orders of magnitude more expensive, with unknown level of certainty.

How about you, dear reader? Would you agree that not all problems are Engineering problems? Have you seen similar situations that you would care to share?
