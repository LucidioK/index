# So, was my MBA worth the effort and cost?

After I have finished my MBA at the University of Washington (UW), this is a question that I hear all the time. For me, professionally and financially, the answer is a resounding yes, but in a way that I did not expect. The Return on Investment analysis ended being surprising in both sides of the equation.

As for investment of time and money, there was much more time investment than what I have initially predicted, even after taking into account the constant warnings from work colleagues and the UW admission crew. There were many weeks where I was studying full time, some assignments that took multiple weeks working from 7AM to 11PM. Regarding the financial costs, Microsoft covered about half the tuition costs with our tuition reimbursement program. Also, with my seniority at Microsoft, I had enough vacation days to use them for these burst weeks. Just two more reasons to love this company.

If I would consider just the quantity of time that is needed to execute a good MBA, well, I would not have joined the program. Time flies when I am learning and in the company of smart people. The practical results were delightful: in one consulting opportunity, we have found a way for a company to profit many millions of dollars by improving one step in one assembly line by one second. Don’t know about you, but this is the kind of stuff that makes me howl with excitement.

The return side of the equation have indeed unforeseen aspects. I did not get a salary raise, nor a promotion, at least not yet. Nevertheless, the already accrued benefits have already covered the costs. I will just talk about what I have applied from my learning about finances and negotiations, so I don’t bore you with details.

With what I have learned about finances, leadership and companies, risk and other areas, I have built a stock portfolio that have already covered what I have paid in tuitions. Until I have started my MBA, I was only investing in mutual funds, with accumulated returns that did not beat S&P 500. Now that I know what to look after, I can select companies that are worth investing.

I use the acquired knowledge in negotiation strategies in a daily basis. It was key for me to promote eleven out of twelve people that have reported to me, to get into the professional opportunities that I have gotten in the past two years, even with my relationship with my wife and sons.

So yes, I had palpable results from my time and money invested in my MBA. And you, dear reader, are you considering a Masters study program? Why? Or maybe you have already graduated and would like to share your experiences?
