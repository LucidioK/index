# I am a feminist

Prejudice, by definition, is asinine. If the discrimination target is over half of mankind, as it is the case for misogyny, it is statistically fallacious.

When I was a little kid, I called my brother “mulherzinha”(little woman). Once. When mom heard that, she scolded us in a way I will never forget:

“I am very much a woman, and I am tougher than both of you or most men I have met. I’ll show you who’s the little woman!” One slap upside the head was enough to learn the lesson forever.

Fast forward some decades. One day, when I picked my older son from the school bus (he was around five years old), he was singing:

“Boys go to college to get more knowledge, girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider (sic)”.

I stopped immediately and asked him:

“Do you really think girls are stupid?”

He instantly answered yes, without thinking. I inquired him “So you think your mom is stupid? Or your friends Gabriela and Catarina? Or both your grandmas? Would you tell that to them? Are you saying that 3.5 billion people are dopey because they are female?”

He reflected for some time, and we agreed that he should not sing that song; that there are smart and not-so-smart people of all sizes, shapes, colors and genders. Interestingly enough, I had this very same conversation with my younger son when he was about the same age.

I thought chauvinistic behavior was a thing of the past, but time and again I have noticed its ugly manifestations in not-so-subtle situations. In one case, I was managing a team of engineers; they were complaining about an abrasive female colleague, how she was abrupt and behaved as a know-it-all.

After I have met her personally, my conclusion was that she indeed knew all about the area that we were working, due to deep professional experience. And yes, she was opinionated, ambitious and a dedicated mom. As I was talking with her, she mentioned that she is trying hard not to be abrasive as part of her career path. The same day, I gathered my team and asked them what would be their opinion if she was a dude. No replies. I told them, if she was a dude, you would think she is self-motivated and you would be OK with that. Simply, our culture still does not accept a woman that has more drive and skills than her male colleagues. Unless someone stops this nonsense. From that moment on, she could behave her way, there were no more mumbling about abrasiveness, and the whole team moved smoothly and productively.

Now my younger son tells me I should consider myself an egalitarian, instead of a feminist. Indeed, the same reasoning can be applied to other sorts of prejudice; from racism to homophobia to ageism. If someone’s behavior is annoying you, consider what would be your opinion in case someone from the hegemonic group behaves similarly. Paraphrasing Martin Luther King, only light can drive out darkness. Yet, light does not emerge from nothing, someone must cause it to exist and elucidate: you.

This simple thought process can improve the lives of everyone around you, with direct impact in productivity. Yes, higher productivity, because ultimately what makes a company more competitive than its peers in a sustainable way is its pool of ideas. If one company accepts only ideas from one group while another manages to bring ideas from all its talented people, guess who will win in the long run?
