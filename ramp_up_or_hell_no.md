# Ramp-up or Hell-No!

How many times have you seen or been through this situation: you start a new job, and you are immediately supposed to start tackling impossible tasks? You feel overwhelmed and work awfully long hours to try to compensate for the fact that you do not have enough domain knowledge. You spend one year striving to ramp-up. If you are lucky, due to your previous experience coupled with unending determination, you might acquire enough tribal knowledge and be fully productive.

Many (I would dare to say most people) would say that this is normal, the good-old “drop them in the frying pan”.

I vehemently disagree.

First, it is unproductive. Specially on high-turnover companies (more on that later), someone with no domain knowledge would have lower throughput as compared to a fully ramped-up person. Second, it fosters an environment with a myriad of opportunities for mistakes. Azure’s down time on 09/28/2020 was caused by a rookie pushing untested code. Third, dropping people in the frying pan is a sure way to worsen turnover, which in turn will worsen productivity and increase the chance for mistakes. The vicious cycle ensues.

Facebook has a fantastic ramp-up program, where you spend around three months learning their engineering practices. But they are the exception that confirms the rule.

For my team, I created a ramp-up program. I wrote a 2-pages document, which was significantly improved by the whole team. New people followed the document and expanded it. Even seasoned engineers executed parts of the ramp-up program. Most importantly, new engineers were given the time and resources to learn, and all team members were on board.

Next time you are about to jump into a new job opportunity, ask for their ramp-up program document. If they do not have one, say a rotund “Hell No”!
