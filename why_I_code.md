# Why I code

I have switched from individual contributor to manager three times in my career. I am a manager now and I keep coding, like in my previous management stints. Most other managers believe this is preposterous or even counterproductive. Some are even proud of not coding anymore. Allow me to kindly disagree here and list the reasons why I code.
## 0 Coding is fun
For me, writing code brings the same endorphins as when I built Legos when I was a kid. It’s such a delight to build something, test it and see it come to life. Programming forces me to learn, which is my preferred activity by far.

## 1 To take decisions based on data
It is a management axiom that data-based decisions are much better than gut-feeling decisions. The main issue here is that data is never in the proper format, sources, and processing scale. Regarding format, many times we need to retrieve data from unformatted documents, databases, logs, and many other formats. As for sources, it is wonderful when we can consult data on Power BI or Kusto, but there are countless data sources ranging from documents on a WebDAV site to structured databases to logs to Kusto clusters and so on. Even if we can get data in a usable format and accessible format, in many cases we need to prepare the data so processing it will not take years.
So, it is no surprise that I code mostly to retrieve data for better decisions. Most coding I do falls into the data-combing category.

## 2 So my team has a seasoned developer when needed
I have heard this many times: Oh, what a hard life, I need a developer for two weeks to solve problem X but all my engineers are busy!
How about just saying, “hold my beer” and doing it?

## 3 So I can provide better effort estimations
Knowing what must be done to implement features, impromptu estimates end up being quite close to more rigorous estimates and the actual effort.

## 4 To have meaningful architectural discussions
In theory, software architecture should be independent from the underlying technology being used to implement it. In practice, during architectural discussions, a manager must understand the tradeoffs between options that are intertwined with coding-level aspects. Should IDs be stored on Redis? How about removing all data storage for our services? Or using Chain of Responsibility for these validation rules so it is easier to expand it later?

## 5 Code is the best language for… coding
Most times, it is easier to explain what's needed through code than with countless documents. Code is unambiguous. So, many times it is more productive to create simple prototypes with the basic functionality for a new feature and include the main code on the work items.

## 6 It is my job security
A previous manager told me that I am lucky since I kept my coding skills. He wanted to move to another position, but he was able to apply for management positions only. We never know what the future holds for us. I was laid off once, having coding skills allowed me to find a job quickly.

## 7 Yes, but this will keep you only doing tactical and no strategic work
That is the objection I hear most often when I say I code. Coding actually automates the tactical work and frees more time for strategic thinking.
What do you think?
